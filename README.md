# Natural-Selection-Remasterd
A remastered version of my [CellSystem](https://github.com/SomewhatMay/CellSystem) project in C# for performance improvements :)

The original code was written in Lua (Lua54) using the LÃ¶ve2D framework. Lua is fun to code in but is terribly slow at runtime execution (slower than python!) which means it's terrible for simulations and machine learning projects.

This serves as a fun way for me to learn a strongly typed language while re-coding a project that will actually benifit from changing the code base and language.

All work is subject to change, if you have any questions or suggestions, let me know!
