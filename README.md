# Natural-Selection-Remasterd
A remastered version of my [CellSystem](https://github.com/SomewhatMay/CellSystem) project in C# for performance improvements :)

Lua is fun to code in but is terribly slow at runtime executtions (slower than python!) which means it's terrible for simulations and machine learning projects.

This serves as a fun way for me to learn a strongly typed language while recoding a project that will actually benifit from changing the code base.

All work is subject to change, if you have any questions or suggestions, let me know!
